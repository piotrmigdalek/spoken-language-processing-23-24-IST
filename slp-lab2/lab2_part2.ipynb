In particular, x-vectors are the current state of the art approach to obtain speech embeddings that characterize very efficiently speaker or language, among others. X-vectors are neural models typically trained for speaker identification in a supervised way, but also in some cases for other related tasks, like language recognition. Once trained, they can be used to obtain a single embedding vector of fixed dimension for each audio input. This vector corresponds to the activations of one of the layers after the pooling layer. \n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of this part of the laboratory is to expose students to modern tools and methods for speech classification.\n",
    "In particular, we will use the [s3prl](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) toolkit to build a native language identification system based on self-supervised learning (SSL) models as feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[s3prl](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) is an open source toolkit, which stands for Self-Supervised Speech Pre-training and Representation Learning. Self-supervised speech pre-trained models are called upstream in this toolkit and are utilized in various downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolkit permits pre-training upstream models, load already pre-trained upstream models and/or utilize these upstream models in lots of downstream tasks already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, the faculty team configured a downstream task and a simple model specifically for our native language identification task and data. The model consists of a projection layer, followed by an average pooling, and a linear output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lab, students are  expected to *play* with the different upstream models to build the best possible native language identification system. \n",
    "In particular, students are encouraged to explore and discover which of the available SSL models can be a better candidate for their classification system. Note that using a large SSL model will make the training process very slow. So, you must choose wisely depending for instance on the reported performance in similar tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides playing with the different upstream models, interested students can try to modify some of the details of the \"expert\" downstream model. This can be done following some of the many examples already included in the toolkit as a starting point, but it may be challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In contrast to the x-vector based system and the notebook of Part 1, for the SSL system, we will make use of some Python scripts that are part of the S3PRL framework. These are typically run in a terminal, so, some of the following steps may be simpler to run in a terminal, rather than as cell in the Notebook itself.**"
